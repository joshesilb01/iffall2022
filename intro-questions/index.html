            <li>Josh Silber, Mechanical Engineering (Design Minor), Senior</li>
            <li>I'm becoming more and more interested in digital media, content creation, and digital design. Furthering my capability to express myself, as well as be a capable individual.</li>
            <li>I took CSE131. So basic JS experience</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to format my own portfolio page, or at least start to understand what would be necessary (or what resources would be available) to do so</li>
            <li>The scale and frame of view is adjustable digitally, so I expect the maluability of visuals to be more important in the digital design (whether for utility or cosmetics)</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.patatap.com/">Patatap</a> is a well designed site, it conveys simple instructions upon arrival, and lets you discover extremely simple yet fun sounds and visuals upon typing letters. One thing that is not conveyed is that the space bar actually resets the whole creative space, changing the sounds and colors associated to all of the keys' animations (if this was a conscious choice, it's a strong one leaving the sense of discovery up to the user).</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> is a strong site, because navigational features are organized on the top; the content upload interface clearly displays the ability to start your post creation with a link, image, or video; and the website refreshes the 'for you' content when you click on the reddit icon in the top left.</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://genius.com/#featured-stories">Genius</a> is very effective as a website depicting the exclusives and "behind-the-scene" journalism relating to music (giving credit to a lot of hip-hop and rap). <br>When looking at the charts (and whats trending), they have drop-downs and filters to display what's trending. <br>When looking at a lyrics explanation page (example: <a href="https://genius.com/Ben-e-king-stand-by-me-lyrics">Stand By Me - Ben E. King</a>) the top bar actually adjusts as you scroll down, turning from the site navigator to the page navigator. <br>Additionally, everything is in a clean yet punk style (my favorite being Genius's unique "n"). </li>
        </ol>
